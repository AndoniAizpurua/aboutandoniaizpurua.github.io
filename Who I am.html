	  <h1><p align="center"><u><font color="black">WHO I AM</font></u></p></h1>
	  <h3><p align="left"><p><img src="Aboutme.JPG" width="550" height="375" alt="" border="5" align="right">
	  My name is Andoni Aizpurua and I am studying for a Certificate
	  of higher Education on Robotics and industrial automations in Zarautz (Spain).<br /></p>
	  <br />
	  <p>While growing up I discovered my enthusiasm for electronics and for building and making
	  things myself, mainly because of my fathers passion for building things.
	  Since I was young I've always helped my father either building or fixing things and making different projects.
	  As my father is a teacher on higher education he has always encouraged me to handcraft
	  things and he has tought me a lot throught the years, not just about electronics, 
	  but also to handcraft wood and different materials and to repair mechanical
	  parts of some vehicles and machines (bikes, household appliances...).<br /></p>
	  <br />
	  
	  <p>Apart from a handyman, I consider myself as a hard worker, ambitious and dependable. I 
	  really like to get things done as good as possible and I enjoy working mostly in
	  everything, and I always try to keep my promises.
	  I reckon myself as a pretty energetic<br /> and positive guy because I really like all kind
	  of sports and despite making mistakes,<br /> I try to learn from them and to always keep
	  a positive mindset.</font></p></p></h3>

	  <br />
	  I mostly like spending my free time in my two main hobbies, playing guitar and sports.<br />
	  <br />
	  Since I was a kid I've always liked doing sports, so when I was 11 years old I joined the local athletics club
	  (<a href="https://antonianoke.wordpress.com/">Antoniano Kirol Elkartea</a>), in where I've trained since
	  then and where I've become coach and press director of the club. Futhermore, I like other sports too,<br />
	  such as mountain biking and slacklining, which I usually practice during summer holidays. </p><br />
	  
	  <p><br />
	  Apart from doing sports, one of my main hobbies is playing guitar. I started playing the old guitar in the wardrobe of my house
	  when I was around 11-12 years old, and after 3 years learning how to play the classic and the electric guitars in an academy,
	  I've spent the other four years leaning and improving on my own.
	  <img src="Guitar.JPG" width="500" height="320" alt="" border="5" align="right">
	  This hobbie, which I practice every day, has gone so far to the point I own four guitars and I've even built my own.</p><br />
	   <p>Besides that, I enjoy learning new things and developing my knownledge in every way possible.
